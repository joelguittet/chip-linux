Allwinner A10 Display Pipeline
==============================

The Allwinner A10 Display pipeline is composed of several components
that are going to be documented below:

TV Encoder
----------

The TV Encoder supports the composite and VGA output. It is one end of
the pipeline.

Required properties:
 - compatible: value should be "allwinner,sun4i-a10-tv-encoder".
 - reg: base address and size of memory-mapped region
 - clocks: the clocks driving the TV encoder

TCON
----

The TCON acts as a CRTC and encoder for RGB / LVDS interfaces.

Required properties:
 - compatible: value should be "allwinner,sun4i-a10-tcon".
 - reg: base address and size of memory-mapped region
 - interrupts: interrupt associated to this IP
 - clocks: phandles to the clocks feeding the TCON. Three are needed:
   - 'ahb': the interface clocks
   - 'tcon-ch0': The clock driving the TCON channel 0
   - 'tcon-ch1': The clock driving the TCON channel 0

 - clock-names: the clock names mentionned above
 - clock-output-names: Name of the pixel clock created


Display Engine Backend
----------------------

The display engine backend exposes layers and sprites to the
system. It's split into two components, the frontend and backend, the
frontend doing formats conversion, scaling, deinterlacing, while the
backend actually manages the layers.

Required properties:
  - compatible: value must be one of:
    * allwinner,sun5i-a13-display-engine

  - reg: base address and size of the memory-mapped region. Two are needed:
    * backend0: registers of the display engine backend
    * frontend0: registers of the display engine frontend
  - reg_names: the region names mentionned above.

  - interrupts: frontend interrupt phandle

  - clocks: phandles to the clocks feeding the frontend and backend
    * backend0-bus: the backend interface clock
    * backend0-mod: the backend module clock
    * backend0-ram: the backend DRAM clock
    * frontend0-bus: the frontend interface clock
    * frontend0-mod: the frontend module clock
    * frontend0-ram: the frontend DRAM clock
  - clock-names: the clock names mentionned above

  - resets: phandles to the reset controllers. Two are needed:
    * backend0: backend reset controller
    * frontend0: frontend reset controller
  - reset-names: the reset names mentionned above

  - allwinner,tcon: phandle to the TCON in our pipeline

Optional properties:
  - allwinner,tv-encoder: phandle to the TV Encoder in our pipeline
  - allwinner,panel: phandle to the panel used in our RGB interface

Example:

panel: panel {
	compatible = "olimex,lcd-olinuxino-43-ts";
};

tve: encoder@01c0a000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-tv-encoder";
	reg = <0x01c0a000 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&ahb_gates 34>;
};

tcon: lcd-controller@01c0c000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-tcon";
	reg = <0x01c0c000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <44>;
	clocks = <&ahb_gates 36>,
		 <&tcon_ch0_clk>,
		 <&tcon_ch1_clk>;
	clock-names = "ahb",
		      "tcon-ch0",
		      "tcon-ch1";
	clock-output-names = "tcon-pixel-clock";
};

de: display-engine@01e00000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun5i-a13-display-engine";
	reg = <0x01e00000 0x20000>,
	      <0x01e60000 0x10000>;
	reg-names = "frontend0",
		    "backend0";
	interrupts = <47>;
	interrupt-names = "engine0";
	clocks = <&ahb_gates 46>, <&de_fe_clk>,
		 <&dram_gates 25>, <&ahb_gates 44>,
		 <&de_be_clk>, <&dram_gates 26>;
	clock-names = "frontend0-bus", "frontend0-mod",
		      "frontend0-ram", "backend0-bus",
		      "backend0-mod", "backend0-ram";
	resets = <&de_fe_clk>,
		 <&de_be_clk>;
	reset-names = "frontend0",
		      "backend0";

	allwinner,tcon = <&tcon>;
	allwinner,tv-encoder = <&tve>;
	allwinner,panel = <&panel>;
};
